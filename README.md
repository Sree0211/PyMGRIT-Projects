# PyMGRIT Projects: Parallel MultiGrid Reduction in Time

## Overview
This repository contains projects based on the PyMGRIT (Parallel MultiGrid Reduction in Time) library. PyMGRIT is a powerful tool for solving time-dependent problems using the multi-grid reduction in time approach. These projects showcase the application of PyMGRIT to various time-dependent problems, emphasizing parallelization, efficient time-stepping, and accurate results.
